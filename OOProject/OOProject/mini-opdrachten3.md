1. **Shape Area Calculation with Overriding**:
   - Create an abstract `Shape` class with an abstract `CalculateArea()` method. Implement subclasses like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`, each overriding `CalculateArea()` with specific logic.

2. **Animal Sounds with Method Overriding**:
   - Design an `Animal` base class with a virtual method `MakeSound()`. Derive classes like `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`, each overriding `MakeSound()` to return their specific sound.

3. **Sealed Calculator Class**:
   - Create a `Calculator` class with basic arithmetic methods (add, subtract, etc.). Make the class sealed to prevent it from being inherited.

4. **Static Utilities Class**:
   - Develop a static class `Utilities` that contains static methods for common operations like calculating percentage, distance between two points, etc. These methods should be callable without instantiating the class.

5. **Abstract Art Gallery**:
   - Design an abstract class `Artwork` with properties like title, artist, and year. Include abstract methods for displaying information. Create derived classes for different types of artworks (e.g., `Painting`, `Sculpture`) with specific implementations.

6. **Vehicle Interface Implementation**:
   - Create an `IVehicle` interface with methods like `Start()`, `Stop()`, and `Refuel()`. Implement this interface in different vehicle classes like `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Boat`.

7. **Music Player with Interfaces**:
   - Define an `IMediaPlayer` interface with methods for play, pause, and stop. Implement this interface in classes like `AudioPlayer` and `VideoPlayer`, each with specific details.

8. **Database Access with Abstract Class**:
   - Create an abstract class `Database` with methods like `Connect()`, `Disconnect()`, `Read()`, and `Write()`. Implement derived classes like `SqlDatabase` and `NoSqlDatabase` with specific behaviors.

9. **Educational System with Interfaces and Overriding**:
   - Develop interfaces like `ILecturable`, `IExaminable`, with methods related to teaching and examining. Implement these interfaces in classes like `Professor`, `Student`, each with specific details and overriding methods.

10. **E-Commerce Shopping Experience**:
    - Design an `IProduct` interface with properties like `Name`, `Price`, and methods like `DisplayInfo()`. Implement this interface in various product classes (`Book`, `Electronics`, etc.). Create a `ShoppingCart` class that can store `IProduct` items and calculate the total price.
