### Variables
1. **Temperature Converter**: Create variables to store temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit. Write a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
2. **Shopping List**: Define variables for different grocery items (e.g., milk, bread, eggs) and their quantities. Print a summary of the shopping list.
3. **Car Information**: Define variables for a car's make, model, year, color, and current mileage. Assign values to these variables and print a description of the car.

### Operatoren & if else
1. **Basic Calculator**: Write a program where two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) are input by the user, and the result of the operation is displayed.
2. **Age Classification**: Ask the user to input their age and classify them as 'child', 'teenager', 'adult', or 'senior' based on their age using if-else statements.
3. **Even or Odd**: Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is even or odd.
4. **Grade System**: Take a number score from the user and convert it to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) using if-else conditions.

### Switch Statements & enums
1. **Weekday Finder**: Ask the user to input a number from 1 to 7 and use a switch statement to convert it to the corresponding weekday (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.).
2. **Simple Calculator (Extended)**: Extend the basic calculator to include more operations (like modulus, exponentiation) using switch statements. Use enums for the operations.
4. **Month Name to Number**: Write a program where the user inputs the name of a month, and the program returns its number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.). Do the same for converting the string month to the enum Month.

### Challenges
1. **Leap Year Checker**: Write a program that takes a year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not.
2. **Calculating with time**:
- I want to do calculations with a time
- So if it’s 10.00 and I add 61 minutes, the result should be 11.01
- Don’t use if or another conditional expression, you don’t need it
