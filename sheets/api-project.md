We're going to create a to do app!

We'll create the backend. We will need to have at least the following models and tables:
- ToDo
- User
- UserStatistics (bonus)

Users and Todos will be stored in a database.
Bonus: A Todo can be linked to one user (unless you're up for an extra challenge!). 

Bonus: Per User, you can see the user statistics. Containing data such as: how many total todo's, how many open, how many completed, average time to complete.

Make sure that you can add, change and delete users. And the same for todo's: add, change and delete.

All sorts of bonuses thinkable, e.g.: uploading a CSV file with users and todo's to populate the DB. 

Bonus bonus: maak een mini frontend html, css, js. (fetch om ul list met de todo's the populaten)
